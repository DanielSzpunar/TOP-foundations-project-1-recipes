The Odin Project: Foundations Path - Project 1 - Recipes

Link: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

A very simple project that demonstrates an understanding of HTML and metadata.

While this is a basic review for me, and below my skill level; I chose to complete it following the guidelines of **The Odin Project** and commitment to complete this course, step by step, in its full integrity.


### Project takeaways:

* markdown refresher
* how to display a project through github
* importance of proper html synthax
